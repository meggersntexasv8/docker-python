This is the Dockerfile (etc.) used for building the image that runs python scripts on Kaggle. [Here's](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kaggle/python/) the Docker image on Dockerhub.

For a guide to using the container, see [our blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/02/05/how-to-get-started-with-data-science-in-containers).

**We welcome pull requests** if there are any packages you'd like to add!
